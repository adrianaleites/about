## Discover more about me

**With a strong eye for detail and a curious mind, I’m currently specialising in digital design and front-end development, with a focus on web accessibility.**

My journey started back in 2011, when I was finishing my degree in Digital Arts & Multimedia and I was invited by my teacher [Tiago Pedras](https://tiagopedras.com/) to work at his web design studio under his mentoring. 

In September 2012, I decided to complement my studies with a degree in Communication Design. And right after that, in 2014, I co-founded a design and animation studio, [Snack Studio](https://behance.net/welovesnack), alongside my brother [Nuno Leites](https://nunoleites.com/) and my friend [Carlos Meinedo](https://www.behance.net/carlosmeinedo), that we ran until 2017.

In 2018, I decided to go back to my old passion, the web field, and invested in upgrading my skills and learning new ones. In 2019, I finished a Front-end Development course at [EDIT.](https://weareedit.io/) and I started working as freelance designer and developer, helping small businesses and creatives telling their own stories through custom branding and tailor-made websites. I also worked as UI designer and front-end developer at [esad—idea](https://esadidea.pt/) during some months of 2021.

**In my design/development process, I highly value research, usability, consistency, quality and iteration. And I believe in collaborating and sharing as a mean to grow and achieve great results.**

Apart from my design career, I co-founded and got involved in two cultural projects: [FIS · Festival Internacional de Solos](http://fis.pt/) (2015 – 2021) and Marácula – Cultural Association (2013 – 2018).

In my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends, taking care of my plants, cooking, playing board games, practicing Yoga, [collecting honest and meaningful quotes](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/adrianaquotescollector/) and learning new things.
